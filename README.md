# Hipstapaper - iOS and Mac Reading List App

A macOS, iOS, and iPadOS app written 100% in SwiftUI. Hipstapaper is an app that takes a URL shared from another app via the share extension, loads the page to get the title, and a screenshot, and then saves the resulting bookmark via Core Data. Hipstapaper uses iCloud Core Data syncing via `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` to sync all data between devices. Hipstapaper supports basic tagging and archiving for saved bookmarks.

## How to Get the App

Hipstapaper is tech demo and learning experience, not a fully complete application experience. If you would like to try the app, please use the links below.

- macOS:
    - [Download Notarized Build](http://www.jeffburg.com/zzNotPortfolio/Hipstapaper/current/Hipstapaper.zip)

## Summary of Capabilities

- Basic CRUD management of websites
- Tagging, Filtering, Sorting
- Bulk editing
- State restoration
- iPadOS and macOS Menus
- iPadOS and macOS "Scenes" for multiple window support
- Share extension for adding content
- iCloud Sync

## Why Did I Write This?

Hipstapaper is my tech demo application that I use to experiment with the newest Apple technologies. This latest version tries to accomplish the following:

- Separation of concerns with heavy use of Swift Package Manager
- Light wrapper around Core Data without performance hit.
    - No NSManagedObjects or any Core Data classes are public outside of the `Store` package.
    - Lists of 3000+ items load and scroll in iOS at 120Hz without issue.
- 100% Cross-platform SwiftUI
    - No Catalyst
    - No trap-doors to UIKit/AppKit (as few as possible ðŸ˜›).
    - Avoid platform specific code.
    - Avoid hacks because SwiftUI is broken.
- Support latest SwiftUI & OS Features
    - Navigation
    - Menus
    - Customizable Toolbars
    - Scenes
    - more

## Known Issues

- Toolbars in Sheets and Popovers on macOS is ugly.
    - This is because SwiftUI still does not render toolbars in sheets and popovers like iOS does.
- Window size is forgotten when closing browser windows on macOS.
